This is a web devlopment folder with all my projects to that so the files are most likely going to hold
multiple languages in a same project. I will try to name this in every folder I go to make sure that the info
us understanble for my future use ever if I need to.

I wanted to make this folder more of something that is like a folder with just CSS and just HTML
but its harder to do that because there will be projects with js and CSS with HTML that will require
me to have those files in the same folder so it is easier for the code to understand and also to make
the code a lot simpler by not writing the file path to every file in a code. Also outside in file 
explorer I would have to name the files to make sure that they are all refering to the same project.

So a lot more folders are going to be in here. ONE FOLDER FOR ONE PROJECT [HOPEFULLY]
